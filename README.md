Hi! This is my first independent Python project. A simple CLI Task Tracker.

I might not have followed the original assignment perfectly, but I did it a bit my own way.
I'm a beginner in Python and made this project entirely by myself, without following YouTube tutorials.

How to use:
1.Run the program
2.Once started, a menu will appear with options (enter a number from 1 to 4):

Creating Task:
Choose option 1.
Enter a name for your task.
The terminal will display:
Task status (default: to-do)
Creation time (dd/mm/yyyy hh/mm/ss)
Last updated time (dd/mm/yyyy hh/mm/ss)

Updating Task:
Choose option 2.
Select the task you want to update.
Change its status to one of: to-do, in-progress, done.
The last updated time will automatically change.

Deleting Task:
Choose option 3.
Select the task you want to delete.
The task will be removed from the list.

Exiting the program
Option 4 exits the program.

All tasks are saved in the tasks.json file.
The program is fully terminal-based and uses a simple text interface.
This is my first Python project, so any feedback is very welcome!
